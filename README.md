# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

## Algorithm

The basic algorithm works as follows:
1. Compare the first two elements of the list.
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Compare the second and third elements of the list.
4. If the second element is greater than the third element, swap them.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all elements in the list until the second last element.
6. Continue to pass through the list until no more swaps are required.

## Time Complexity

The worst-case time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2). This is because in the worst case scenario, the algorithm needs to swap every adjacent pair of elements in the list in order to fully sort it. 

## Usage

Bubble Sort is a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm, but it is not efficient for large lists. It is often used for educational purposes to teach the concept of sorting algorithms. 

In practice, more efficient sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort are usually used.
